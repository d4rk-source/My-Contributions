# 🧠 My First CTF — NPA (“Never Poor Again”)

**NPA — “Never Poor Again”** is a deliberately vulnerable **DeFi mock-corporation** built for aspiring auditors, ethical hackers, and smart contract enthusiasts who want to sharpen their skills in finding, understanding, and fixing real-world Solidity vulnerabilities.

### 🎯 Reason for Creation

I built this project to deepen my understanding of the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, **smart contract development**, and **Solidity security**.
At the same time, I wanted to create something useful for others — a hands-on environment where players can learn to think like auditors and improve their bug-hunting process.

### 🧩 What Makes This CTF Original

This CTF isn’t about just finding one bug and moving on.
It’s designed to simulate the **entire audit cycle**:

1. **Discover vulnerabilities** across multiple contracts.
2. **Document your findings** clearly and logically.
3. **Patch the vulnerabilities** and verify the fixes.
4. **Repeat** — until every part of the system is secure.

It includes **multiple types of vulnerabilities**, encouraging iterative testing and continuous improvement — just like a real audit.
